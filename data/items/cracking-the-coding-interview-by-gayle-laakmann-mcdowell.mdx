Cracking the Coding Interview is the result of my first-hand experience interviewing at top companies and later coaching candidates through the interview process. It is the result of hundreds of conversations with candidates. It is the result of reading dozens of books on interviewing. It is the result of thousands of hours spent on resumes, phone screens, and interviews.
